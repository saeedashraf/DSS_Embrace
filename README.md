A collaborative environment to embrace deep uncertainties in decision making on climate risks


Climate change impacts will become more pronounced in the next decades. Decision on climate risks is riddled with deep uncertainties. We plan to co-design and deploy a decision support system which assist decision makers, businesses and city planners to deal with deeply uncertain problems for smart and robust adaptation planning and implementation.
