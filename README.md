# DSS_Embrace
A collaborative environment to embrace deep uncertainties in decision making on climate risks

We plan to co-design and deploy a decision support system which assist decision makers, businesses and city planners to deal with deeply uncertain problems for smart and robust adaptation planning and implementation.
